# J.A.T.E - Just Another Text Editor

## Description
This singple-page text editor application was created with full PWA capabilities. 

## Installation
The user will need to install node packages locally to run this application. 

The user will also need to have mySQL login in order to access this application. 

## Usage
This application allows the user to use a back-end interface to display the results of their queries. In our case, we used Insomnia (as seen below). 

For example, when making a GET request at the products url, the user can then see all products (along with the associated category and any associated tags).

![the Insomnia window showing the results of accessing the URL to get all products](/assets/allProductsResults.jpg)

This is just one of the many queries that users can complete. 

Users are also able to:
- **View all** products, tags, or categories.
- **View any individual** product, tag, or category.
- **Add** a new product, tag, or category.
- **Update** any product, tag, or category.
- **Delete** any product, tag, or category.
